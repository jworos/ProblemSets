Problem 2

For this problem, I connected my phone to my computer using Xender, then I scanned the IP address from Xender connecting my Pc and Phone using Zenmap app.

Before scanning, I sent packets to the IP (172.20.10.1) using the ping command

After scanning, I got the following open ports;

21 - Ftp
53 - Domain 
6789 - Ibm-db2-admin
62078 - iPhone-sync

I was able to connect to these ports successfully using Netcat on terminal.
